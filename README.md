# Overt and covert speech classification from surface EMG using CNNs

Reanalysing the data from [Nalborczyk et al. (2020, PLOS ONE)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233282) using deep neural networks. For tutorial purposes mostly.

## Setup

...

## Performance

Validation accuracy is around 75% just using the OOI...
Validation accuracy is around 80% when using both the OOI and the ZYG...
Validation accuracy is around 80% when using all four facial muscles (OOI, ZYG, COR, FRO)...
NB: it was 0.848 [0.816, 0.877] using random forest and all four facial muscles...
